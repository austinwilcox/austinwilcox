- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tools that supplement the digital training content over at [The Arbinger Institute](https://arbinger.com)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Data Structures and Algorithms, GO, and Deno are my hobby languages/runtimes.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use neovim, and I build custom handwired keyboards. My current daily driver is a Dactyl Manuform that I 3d printed and handwired: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JaExLg3.jpg)
